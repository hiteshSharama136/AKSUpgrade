### **Technical Workflow for Azure Infrastructure Architecture**

#### **1. Ingress Traffic Flow**
- **Public DNS**: External client requests are directed to a **Public DNS** that resolves the domain name for the application.
- **RQNS Gateway (Subscription 1)**: The requests are received by the **Application Gateway** in Subscription 1. The Application Gateway is responsible for load balancing, TLS termination, and forwarding traffic to the internal resources.
- **Forwarding to AKS (Subscription 2)**: The Application Gateway forwards the requests to an **Internal Load Balancer** in Subscription 2, which routes them to the **AKS Cluster**.

---

#### **2. Application Processing in AKS Cluster**
- **Istio Service Mesh**: Requests are routed through the **Istio Service Mesh** hosted inside the AKS cluster. Istio handles service-to-service communication, traffic routing, and observability for the microservices.
- **CRD Service**: 
  - The request is processed by the **CRD Service**, which performs the necessary operations based on the application logic.
  - Processed data is then enqueued into an **Azure Service Bus (Message Queue)** for further processing.

---

#### **3. Orchestrator Workflow**
- **Message Processing**:  
  The **Orchestrator Service** consumes messages from the **Service Bus** and initiates a workflow.  
- **Workflow Execution**:  
  - The workflow is executed step-by-step, and at each step, results are temporarily stored in **Redis Cache** for fast access and improved performance.  
  - At the end of the workflow, the orchestrator calls the **Function App**, which aggregates and finalizes the results.  

---

#### **4. Data Storage**
- **Storage Account**:  
  - The **Function App** writes the final workflow results to an **Azure Storage Account** for long-term persistence.  
  - This ensures that processed data is safely stored and can be accessed as needed.  

---

#### **5. Networking**
- **Private Endpoints and Private DNS Zones**:  
  - All inter-resource communication (e.g., between AKS, Service Bus, Redis, Storage Account, and Function App) is secured via **Private Endpoints**.  
  - **Private DNS Zones** are configured to resolve private IPs for these resources, ensuring that no traffic is exposed publicly.

---

#### **6. Monitoring and Security**
- **Key Vault**:  
  - Secrets such as connection strings, API keys, and certificates are securely stored in **Azure Key Vault**, ensuring sensitive information is never exposed.
- **Monitoring Tools**:
  - **Azure Monitor and Application Insights**: Provide telemetry, log collection, and performance monitoring for the entire infrastructure, including AKS and other services.
  - **Log Analytics Workspace**: Consolidates logs and diagnostic data for advanced troubleshooting and alerting.
- **NSG (Network Security Groups)**:
  - NSGs enforce strict traffic controls between resources, ensuring only authorized communication is allowed within the environment.

---

#### **End-to-End Workflow**
1. External requests arrive at the **Application Gateway** via Public DNS in Subscription 1.
2. Traffic is forwarded to the **AKS Cluster** (via an internal load balancer) in Subscription 2.
3. The **Istio Service Mesh** routes requests to the **CRD Service**.
4. The **CRD Service** processes requests and pushes them to the **Service Bus**.
5. The **Orchestrator** consumes messages from the **Service Bus**, executes a workflow, stores intermediate results in **Redis**, and calls the **Function App** at the workflow's end.
6. The **Function App** stores aggregated results in the **Storage Account**.
7. All communication is handled via **Private Endpoints** and secured using **Private DNS Zones**.
8. The environment is monitored using **Application Insights** and secured using **Key Vault** and **NSGs**.
